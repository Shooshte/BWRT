#Task: Build a Crypto Trading Dashboard

Develop a web-based trading app. The app will allow users to view real-time crypto prices,
analyze trends with charts, and simulate trades for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
and Ethereum. Users can also view their portfolio summary with profit/loss calculations.
Main Features

### 1. Crypto Price Chart

• Display a real-time price chart for a selected cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC or ETH).
• Show price movements for the past 24 hours.
• Use a line chart to plot the data.

### 2. Mock Trading

• Create a buy/sell interface where users can simulate trades for selected
cryptocurrencies.
• Update the user’s portfolio immediately after a trade (no backend required).

### 3. Portfolio Overview

• Display the user's current crypto holdings and transaction history.
• Calculate and display profit/loss based on the latest prices.

Use the Figma specification as a reference for design implementation. While the provided
design is for a mobile app, adapt the same style to create a responsive design suitable for
desktop screens.

## Tech Requirements

### React

• Build the app using React. Use modern React features such as hooks.

### State Management

• Use Redux (or another state management library) to handle the app's data, such as
prices, trades, and portfolio information.

### Charting

• Use a charting library like Recharts or Chart.js.

### Data Source

• Use a free API like CoinGecko, CoinCap, or Binance API.

### Error Handling

• Gracefully handle errors, such as when API calls fail or return invalid data.

### Styling

• Use your preferred CSS framework or library (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or plain
CSS).

### Extra Points

1. Testing
   a. Write unit tests for key components using a testing library such as Jest or
   React Testing Library.
2. Performance Optimization
   a. Implement optimizations like debouncing the search input and lazy loading
   components.
3. Real-Time Data Updates
   a. Fetch crypto prices periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds) to update the UI.
   Development Practices
   • Use Git for version control, and ensure meaningful commit messages.
   • Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
   • Keep it as simple as the nature of this problem allows it. Do not over-engineer.
   Submission Guidelines
   Share the GitHub repository link with a README file containing:
   • Instructions for setting up and running the app locally.
